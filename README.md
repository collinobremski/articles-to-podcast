# Pocket to Podcast

We had a backlog of articles bookmarked in [pocket](getpocket.com) and were struggling to get through them.  At the same
 time, we've been listening to more and more podcasts on the office commute.
 
Here-in lies a service to convert all unread articles in a users pocket queue to a podcast.  The text to speech 
conversion is handled by [IBM Watson](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/).
